The beginning of this adventure starts normally but after some moments it gets quite unique.
I flew on January 17th due to some issues with my residence permit (I was supposed to arrive early January), and for that reason I was thinking on drop everthing to the garbage and don't come. For a moment I was decided to save the money for future trips but fortunately I changed my mind, so now you can read this blog.



1. Turku
