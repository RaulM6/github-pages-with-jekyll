## Bienvenidos, welcome, välkommen, tervetuloa, üdvözöllek, 환영합니다, bienvenue.

Here you will read a bad english attempt to describe what is living (in turku so far) and traveling to some countries as a Mexican.
More than an informative blog, this is my point of view, this is how a 26 years old from the north of Mexico experiences meeting new people, new languages and new places.

Sit, tight your belt, relax, take your popcorns and travel back with me to my memories.
